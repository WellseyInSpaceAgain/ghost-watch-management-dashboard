# Ghost Watch Management Dashboard

A local Ghost Watch operations console. Economics is the first module; the full brief is in [initial-prompt.md](initial-prompt.md).

## Development

Requires .NET SDK 10 and Node.js 22.22.3+ (or a supported newer version).

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet tool restore
dotnet run --project src/GhostWatch.Api
```

In another terminal:

```bash
cd src/GhostWatch.Web
npm ci
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:4200. The Angular development server proxies `/api` to the backend on http://localhost:5080.

## Verification

```bash
dotnet build
dotnet test
cd src/GhostWatch.Web
npm run build
```

## Structure

- `src/GhostWatch.Api`: .NET 10 API, EF Core 10 / SQLite persistence.
- `src/GhostWatch.Web`: Angular 22 and Angular Material console.
- `tests/GhostWatch.Tests`: backend integration and domain tests.
- `docs`: implementation decisions, progress, and EVE reference notes.

This is a new application, database and Git history. The reference exporter remains read-only. No credentials or runtime data are copied. The existing IDE workspace directory is retained; the product identity is **Ghost Watch Management Dashboard**.
